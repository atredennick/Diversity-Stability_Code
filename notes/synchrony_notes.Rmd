From Loreau and de Mazancourt (2008, American Naturalist: [link](http://www.cbtm-moulis.com/fichiers_site/a2992ctm/contenu_pages/loreau_de_mazancourt_am_nat_2008.pdf)), here is the "expected synchrony of per capita population growth rate" under neutral community dynamics:

$$
\phi_r = \frac{\sigma_{c}^2 + \sigma_{e}^2 + \sigma_{d}^2/(S\tilde{N})}
              {[(1/S)(\sum_{i} \sqrt{\sigma_{c}^2 + \sigma_{e}^2 + \sigma_{d}^2/\tilde{N}})]^2}
$$

Here are parameter definitions:

| Parameter | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| $\phi_{r}$ | expected synchrony in per capita growth rates |
| $\sigma_{c}^2$ | community response variance (see definition below) |
| $\sigma_{e}^2$ | environmental variance (equal among species) |
| $\sigma_{d}^2$ | demographic variance (equal among species) |
| $S$ | species richness in community |
| $\tilde{N}$ | harmonic temporal mean of population or community size |

Community response variance is defined as:
$$
\sigma_{c}^2 = \frac 
$$

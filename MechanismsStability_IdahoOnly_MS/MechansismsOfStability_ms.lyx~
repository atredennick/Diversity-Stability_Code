ABSTRACT: 
\series default
While it is now widely accepted that species richness promotes temporal
 stability of ecosystem processes, the mechanisms that confer stability
 in natural communities remain poorly understood.
 In part this is because it is difficult to disentangle proposed mechanisms
 using data from the original experiments designed to detect the general
 trend between species richness and different aspect of ecosystem function.
 Here we take a new, demographic approach toward identifying the mechanisms
 that increase, or decrease, temporal stability of community productivity.
 We used an empirically parameterized population model of a four species
 community in southern Idaho to quantify the relative contribution of three
 proposed mechanisms to temporal stability of annual productivity.
 By perturbing the model to reflect theoretical mechanisms, we found that

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Total biomass of species rich communities tends to be more stable through
 time than species poor communities.
 Though originally a contentious proposition, two decades of theoretical
 and empirical work make clear that often, though not always, species diversity
 begets temporal stability (hereafter, simply `stability').
 Less clear are the mechanisms by which diversity promotes stability.
 Theory has provided several potential mechanisms, but testing for the existence
 and relative importance of proposed mechanisms in natural communities has
 remained a challenge.
 The challenge remained for two reasons: (1) we lacked coherent and general
 theory that predicts stability based on several mechanisms, and (2) we
 lacked data at the temporal and demographic resolution necessary to rigorously
 confront theory.
 Fortunately, these limitations can now be overcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent theoretical work provides an explicit prediction of ecosystem stability
 and related work has identified three main mechanisms that, in combination
 or isolation, can lead to the stabilizing effects of species richness on
 ecosystem stability: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to the environment,
 (2) differences among species' intrinsic rates of natural increase, and
 (3) reduction in the strength of competition.
 Mechanisms 1 and 2 are related to temporal complementarity among species,
 which, in combination, can yield asynchronous population dynamics that
 dampen the effect of environmentl fluctuations.
 Mechanism 3 results from functional complementarity and can lead to increased
 mean biomass when species are in mixture relative to monocultures because
 more niche space is utilized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In combination, these mechanisms provide a pathway for developing testable
 hypotheses of how species-specific properties affect community stability.
 Based on the three mechanisms, we developed a set of hypotheses that can
 be tested by perturbing a population model while keeping species richness
 constant.
 We tested the following hypotheses: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Greater differences in species-specific responses to environment (yearly
 growth rates in a fluctuating environment) will increase temporal stability
 by creating asynchronous population dynamics where a good year for one
 species may be a bad year for another species.
 This leads to the `insurance effect' of biodiversity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Greater differences in species' intrinsic growth rates (low-density growth
 rate in the absence of interspecific competition and temporal fluctuations)
 will increase temporal stability, but to a lesser degree than species-specific
 responses to the environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increasing species' sensitivity to competition will decrease stability because
 mean total biomass will decrease, which leads to an increase in biomass
 variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly, the approach we described below allows us to not only test
 for the operation of these mechanisms, it also allows us to quantify the
 relative contribution of each proposed mechanism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned above, a large hurdle to testing theoretical mechanisms of
 stability is the lack of highly resolved demographic data over relatively
 long time frames.
 We overcome this limitation by using a remarkable historical dataset from
 the sagebrush steppe in southern Idaho.
 The dataset consists of annually mapped quadrats that allow us to track
 the size and fate of individual plants.
 The data allow us to indirectly estimate the species-specific parameters
 needed to test our hypotheses using a multi-species population model.
 With those estimates in hand, we are then in a position to perturb the
 model based on our hypotheses.
 We note from the outset that our goal is to ...

 quadrats between 1926 and 1932.
 Eighteen quadrats were distributed among four ungrazed exclosures, and
 eight were distributed in two pastures grazed at medium intensity from
 spring (April) through fall (October).
 All quadrats were located on similar topography and soils.
 In most years until 1957, all individual plants in each quadrat were mapped
 using a pan- tograph (CITE: Blaisdell 1958).
 Digitized versions of the original maps are available online (CITE: Zachmann,
 Moffet & Adler 2010).
 Our models are based on data from 22 year-to-year transitions between 1926
 and 1957.
 For the first two transitions, only four quadrats were observed, while
 at least 16 quadrats were observed for all subsequent transi- tions.
 Extraction of demographic data is described in detail elsewhere (CITATIONS).

Vital rate regressions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistical models of vital rates (survival, growth, and recruitment) are
 the building blocks of our multi-species integral projection model (IPM).
 Following previous work, we modeled the survival probability and growth
 (the size of a genet at time 
\shape italic
t
\shape default
) as functions of genet size, among year temporal variation, variation due
 to quadrat location, and inter- and intraspecific neighborhood crowding.
 Temporal variation is represented by a random year effect on the intercept
 and a random year effect on the coefficient for genet size (a temporally
 varying slope).
 Unlike previous work, we do not include specific climate covariates, allowing
 the random year effects on the intercept and slope to account for all interannu
al variation.
 We fit the models using INLA (CITATION).
 We used a binomial likelihood for the survival model and a normal likelihood
 for the growth regression.
 Details can be found in Appendix X.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We modeled recruitment at the quadrat level, rather than at the individual
 level, because it is impossible to assign new recruits to a specific genet.
